Simulate a world of tiny tiny cells, where you get to define the rules.  
Your rules may be simple, complex or something god-like, no restrictions for your imagination.  
Start your symphony and let the cells dance to it, make sure it is good.

Rules for creating rules is simple, Explore the world that you created.

## Cellular Automaton
It is a collection of colored cells which evolve each time from the previous state defined by a set of predefined rules. These rules are defined based up the neighboring cells in the grid. 

[The Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Game of Life Wiki") is one among the popular cellular automatons.  
- Rules of Game of Life
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
  - Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
  - All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Based of these three very simple rules, complex behaviours evolved.  

More importantly Cellular Automaton also depends on the initial state of the grid. Changing the initial state may result in a completely different behaviour.
