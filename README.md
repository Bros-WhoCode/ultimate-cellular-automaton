# The World of Automata
Made for [Timathon](https://twtcodejam.net/ "Timathon Code Jams")

Simulate a world of tiny tiny cells, where you get to define the rules.  
Your rules may be simple, complex or something god-like, no restrictions for your imagination.  
Start your symphony and let the cells dance to it, make sure it is good.
